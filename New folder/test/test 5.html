        <h2 id="About">Few Things About Me:</h2>
        <p>I was born in Salisbury, NC in June of 1984.<br>Had a fun childhood and learned a lot from<br>my grandfather and uncle before they passed away.<br>Been through so much in my life that I want to try something new.
          <br>I used to work for a Non-profit organization named Students in Training back in 2013 they closed down in 2020.<br>Then worked at Walmart for three years. After that, I came to Amazon and <br>waited four years until I decided I needed a change in my life, so I came to your program this year.

      <p>Why I wanted to become a software dev because I want more of a challenge in my life. I get bored really easily and need to keep myself motivated <br>a lot more into doing a lot I want more things around software. <br>Never really had the time or the money to go back to school until I got with Amazon.
        Been trying to learn for years but never had time to learn. <br>But Amazon is giving me a chance to learn with people in the industry. I want to see how far the rabbit hole has to go into coding.
