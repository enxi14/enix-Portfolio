    <p>I was born in Salisbury, NC in June of 1984.<br>Had a fun childhood and learned a lot from<br>my grandfather and uncle before they passed away.<br>Been through so much in my life that I want to try something new.
    </p><br>I used to work for a Non-profit organization named Students in Training back in 2013 they closed down in 2020.<br><p>Then worked at Walmart for three years. After that, I came to Amazon and <br>waited four years until I decided I needed a change in my life, so I came to your program this year.
    <br>I have four nephew and a niece and love to spend time with them when i can. Love working on computers and cars when i got time.
