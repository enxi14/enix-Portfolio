Week 4 Project
For this assignment, your task is to add advanced features to your “About Me” page. You should notice that your code is looking increasingly professional, and you are getting closer to having a potential employer looks at what you’ve created to showcase your skills.
For this project, you will be adding advanced css features to your page. You should make frequent use of pseudo-class and pseudo-element items, and include at least two or three of the following in your design:
a sass .scss sheet to produce your css file
media queries
css animations
advanced grid
flexbox
bootstrap
When you’ve updated your page, share the code here
